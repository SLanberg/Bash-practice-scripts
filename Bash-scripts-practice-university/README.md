# Initial Setup

Don't forget to change permissions:
chmod 755 script_name.sh

To run any of the presented scripts from terminal:
./script_name.sh

# t2

In t2 I remember that in the class I was told the .CSV file
itself was not the challenge, and 
white spaces is not supported by Mac pages app, so I hope you will forgive me
for changing it to ";"

Line 13 in t2 can be changed to any delimiter like " ",
",", "@", "^_^" and etc.
So I will omit read prompt for that.

# t4

There is requirement such as:
3) Clone the repo if it's available on “Desktop”, if not should display an appropriate error.

Not sure if I understand it correctly, so I made check if 
Desktop directory is exists and if GitHub repository is presented.

Because I was told that simply telling user to open new terminal window is acceptable
I will do it like that for now.
